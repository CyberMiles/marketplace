### You might want to change the contract (Listing.lity)......

After your updates of contract, do remember to:
1. Compile the new contract and make sure the correctness of your changes.
2. Use the new abi and the bytecode in ``/marketplace/dapp/src/contracts.js``.
3. Calculate the new abiSha using es-ss.js and submit it to the search engine. (Refer to [es-ss.js library](https://github.com/second-state/es-ss.js#sha-an-abi) for more infomation of smart contract search engine api)
4. Replace the variable ``abiShaList`` in``/marketplace/dapp/src/global.js`` with the new calculated abiSha.
5. Modify the front-end logic related to your updated function in the contract.


## In-Depth of the Platform

Each single product in this platform is an individual contract deployed in CyberMiles Blockchain, that is to say, when seller create a listing, what his exact behavior is to deploy a new contract on the CyberMiles Blockchain. Then the other product-related actions (eg. *buy*, *dispute*) are all called at the address of this contract. 

Different actions called on the contract programatically would make the purchase process updated semantically. According to the semantic meaning of different purchase progress, we design some different contract status respectivel. 

![FlowChart of Purchasing](https://github.com/CyberMiles/marketplace/blob/master/docs/MPflowchart.png)

There's 3 parties in this trading system.

- Seller: the owner of the contract.
- Buyer: the buyer. Note that one contract is able to have at most only one buyer.
- DAO: the account address who has the power to deal with the dispute, for example.

The initial status of the contract is **Listing** as the seller deploys it. Seller can switch the contract between the *Listing* and *Unlisting*, where **Unlisting** suggests the buyer is not able to buy it temporarily. The DAO can set the product with *Listing* or *Unlisting* status to **Processing** manually, which means all the actions is not able to run unless the DAO set the *Processing* status back to *Listing*.

When someone calls *Buy* on the product contract, then that person is remarked as the buyer in the contract which slides into the **BuyerLocked** status respectively. It's worth mentioning in this status, the fund from the buyer is locked in the contract for some specific escrow duration, which is set up in the constructor of the contract.

Within the *BuyerLocked* status, if the buyer:
- Do nothing: after the escrow duration, anyone has the permission to transfer the fund from the contract to the seller and then the contract ends up with **BuyerPaid** status, which means whatever the funds eventually flows to the seller side.
- Raise dispute: contract will be set as the **Dispute** status, which means the fund in the contract will be locked until the dispute is resolved by DAO, who can either set judge buyer wins or the seller wins, with contract flowing to *BuyerPaid* and *BuyerRefunded* status respectively. **BuyerRefunded** means whatever the funds eventually flows to the buyer side.
- Call *Receive*: with buyer confirming recipt, the fund in the contract can flow to the buyer side immediately, making the contract to the *BuyerPaid* status.

While the *BuyerLocked* and *Dispute* status, the seller has the ability to refund to the buyer for some business reason (Eg. the destination is out of shipping region).
