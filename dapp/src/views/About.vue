    <ul>
      <li>
        When the buyer pays, the fund is frozen in the smart contract for
        {{ escrowDuration }} days and released to the seller if the buyer has
        not taken any action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Within the {{ escrowDuration }} days if the buyer has any problems (like
        the seller fails to deliver or the product is problematic), the buyer
        can raise a dispute. A third party comes into mediation with the buyersâ€™
        interests in mind.
      </li>
      <li>
        The {{ USDunit }}s are frozen and secured in the smart contract and
        cannot be accessed by any one.
      </li>
    </ul>
